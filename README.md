# Senior-Thesis-Perfect-Discretizations

This repository contains all files used in the computations presented in my senior
thesis for my undergraduate Physics degree at the University of the Pacific. Each file 
has its own documentation. There are a total of 8 files, seven of which are MATLAB function
files.
