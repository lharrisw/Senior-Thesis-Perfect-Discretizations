# Senior-Thesis-Perfect-Discretizations

This repository contains all files used in the computations presented in my senior
thesis for my undergraduate Physics degree at the University of the Pacific.
There are a total of 8 files, seven of which are MATLAB function files.

## Usage

To understand how to use the functions, each function has its own documentation.
