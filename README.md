# Senior-Thesis-Perfect-Discretizations

This repository contains all files used in the computations presented in my senior
thesis for my undergraduate Physics degree at the University of the Pacific. The
purpose of the code was to compare and contrast the standard 5-point and modified
9-point discrete Laplacians with different perfect Laplace operators obtained from
the renormalization group transformation applied to the discrete analog of the 
continuum action for a free scalar field in two dimensions. There are a total of
8 files, seven of which are MATLAB function files.

## Usage

To understand how to use the functions, each function has its own documentation.
